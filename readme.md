**Title:** GUI based calculator with exception handling mechanism.

**Output**


**Introduction:**
The Simple Calculator project is a Java Swing-based desktop application designed to perform 
basic arithmetic operations with a user-friendly interface. It includes buttons for digits (0-9), 
operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, square root), and special 
functions (Clear, Backspace, Equals). The calculator evaluates mathematical expressions 
accurately while respecting operator precedence and displays real-time results on the screen. 
Robust error handling ensures the application manages invalid inputs and arithmetic 
exceptions gracefully, providing informative error messages to the user. This project 
exemplifies effective GUI development in Java, combining functionality and usability.

**Limitations:**
The Simple Calculator has several limitations. It can only handle basic arithmetic operations 
and does not support advanced mathematical functions like trigonometry or logarithms. The 
input format must be strictly adhered to, as the calculator does not parse complex expressions 
or provide syntax correction. Additionally, it operates on a single pair of operands at a time, 
lacking the ability to handle multi-step calculations without intermediate results. The user 
interface, while functional, could benefit from enhancements such as a more responsive 
design and additional user feedback mechanisms.
